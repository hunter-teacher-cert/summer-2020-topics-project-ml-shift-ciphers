# Instructions for using code
When running code, console will ask if you would like to train the system. If you type "n", the system will use standard English frequencies. If you type "y", you will be asked to input a string of text to train the system. The system will create a frequency table based on the training string. Longer strings have a higher change of success. Next, input your encrypted message. The system will then attempt to decrypt your message using frequencies. Choose "y" or "n" to let the system know if the message is decrypted or not. If the system fails, you will have the option to add additional training text to the system to make it smarter.
